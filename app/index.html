            <p>Welcome to Sam's Post-Humous Website by some of family and friends. This site is to share the paintings, stories, movies, and photographs by and about Samuel Palmer Hileman, Jr. 1924-2001. Many of his paintings are scattered around the globe, and people often ask his children where they are and how can they see them again. This is an effort to share the ones that are easily found. It would be wonderful to find more. Sam was a story teller, and this site is also to share stories by and about him. They might be true, they might just be good stories. If you have one to share, you can send it in on page 3. Images also are welcome.</p>
            <p>Kindly do not reproduce these paintings for commercial gain, but feel free to enjoy them in any way you choose: for learning, for fun, for sharing or making new things. Many thanks to the fantastic art photographer Jack Daily, and to all the people who let him into their homes to photograph the paintings</p>
